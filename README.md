# Number Guessing Game ðŸŽ²

A simple number guessing game built with C# and WinForms. In this game, the player has to guess a randomly generated number between 0 and 100. The game provides feedback for each guess, letting the player know if the guess was too high or too low, with a limited number of attempts.

- **Progress Bar**: Visual representation of remaining attempts.
- **Reset Button**: Ability to restart the game at any point.

## Game Rules
1. The player has 8 attempts to guess the correct number.
2. After each guess, the game provides feedback:
   - **Too High**: If the guessed number is greater than the secret number.
   - **Too Low**: If the guessed number is lower than the secret number.
3. The game ends if the player guesses the correct number or runs out of attempts.
